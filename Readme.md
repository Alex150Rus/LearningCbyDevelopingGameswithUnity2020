## Concept
Game prototype focused on stealthy avoiding enemies and collecting health 
items - with a little FPS on the side.

## Gameplay
Main mechanics centers around using line-of-sight to stay one step ahead of
patrolling enemies and collecting required items.

Combat will consist of shooting projectiles at enemies, which will 
automatically trigger an attack response.

## Interface
Control scheme for movement will be WASD or arrow keys using the mouse for
camera control. Shooting mechanics will use the Space bar, and item 
collection will work off of object collisions.

Simple HUD will show items collected and remaining ammo, as well as a 
standard health bar.

## ArtStyle
Level and character art style will be all primitive GameObjects for fast
and efficient, no-frills development. Theses can be swapped out at a later
date with 3D models or terrain environments if needed.
